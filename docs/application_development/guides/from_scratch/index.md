# A gentle(ish) introduction to CHT application development

This guide serves as a gentle bottom-up tutorial on how to create a Core Framework application from scratch.

Over the course of many tutorials we'll go from an empty directory to a complete if small solution that you are able to make changes to and deploy on your local machine. This will arm you with the knowledge to both build your own solutions from scratch, and to edit existing applications such as the default, reference configuation.
