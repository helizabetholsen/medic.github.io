# Overview

The [Community Health Toolkit](http://communityhealthtoolkit.org_) (CHT) is a project by a group of leading organizations who have come together to support the development of digital health initiatives in the hardest-to-reach areas. 

The Community Health Toolkit provides you with resources to design, build, deploy, and monitor digital tools for community health. It includes open source software frameworks and reference applications highlighting common use cases, guides to help design and use them, and a [community forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org) for collaboration and support. Together, we can work toward a world where healthcare is of the highest attainable quality, equitable, accessible, and delivered by the people who are trusted most in their communities.

## The Core Framework
  
The Core Framework makes it faster to build full-featured, scalable digital health apps by providing a foundation developers can build on. These apps can support most languages, are offline-first, and work on basic phones (via SMS), smartphones, tablets, and computers. 

App developers are able to define health system roles, permissions and reporting hierarchies, and make use of five highly configurable areas of functionality: messaging, task and schedule management, decision support workflows, longitudinal person profiles, and analytics. 

The Core Framework can be used to support the unique needs of a given health system and the work of community health workers, frontline supervisors, facility-based nurses, health system managers, and even patients and caregivers.

Access a self-guided demo of an app built with the Core Framework [here](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/contact)

## Antenatal Care Reference App
  
Reference Apps provide organizations with a template for structuring and organizing a community health workflow, its configuration code, and testing framework. They include a foundation for forms, data fields, and even analytics, and can be deployed as-is or easily customized by a developer for your unique context.

  ## Using Tools Built with the Community Health Toolkit in Your Community 
  
The resources provided through the Community Health Toolkit can be used to build digital health apps used at the community, health facility, and health system level:

**At the community level,** community health workers (CHWs) use apps built with the CHT to register patients, conduct guided health assessments, screen for specific conditions and danger signs, and refer patients to health facilities.

**At the health facility level,** nurses and CHW supervisors use apps and admin consoles built with the CHT to coordinate care for patients with the CHWs, promote health practices in the community, and report health and service delivery statistics to health system officials

**At the health system level,** data managers and others use apps and admin consoles built with the CHT to collate and report on key community and health system data. Their work often involves following up with supervisors and nurses to verify data for accuracy and completion.
