## Overview

The [Community Health Toolkit](http://communityhealthtoolkit.org_) (CHT) is a project by a group of leading organizations who have come together to support the development of digital health initiatives in the hardest-to-reach areas. 

The Community Health Toolkit provides you with resources to design, build, deploy, and monitor digital tools for community health. It includes open source software frameworks and applications, guides to help design and use them, and a community forum for collaboration and support. Together, we can work toward a world where healthcare is of the highest attainable quality, equitable, accessible, and delivered by the people who are trusted most in their communities.
